# flight
flight is to be an airline management simulation. Buy airplanes, create routes and watch the cash roll in... or pour out. Obviously, these are very early stages of development and I don't have too much idea what I'm doing. 

## the plan (subject to change)
- Add a database
- Add a GUI
- Make the ability to create routes from a single hub (multiple hubs and/or hops to come later)
- Create costs such as crew, fuel use, landing fees, maintenance and so on
- Add levers such as fares for gaining or losing customers
- Add events ranging from weather delays to full hull losses, which will affect customer demand
- Figure out how to deploy updates for the game
- Launch on Windows Store, Steam, Ubuntu Store and the Mac Store

## contributing
At the moment, I am intent on figuring this stuff out for myself and don't necessarily want someone writing it *for me*. If you'd like to contribute small bits, feel free to do so, but it may be some time before I review it (or it may not, you never know). 

## f.a.q.
### will you charge money for the game?
To be determined. Part of creating this game is the annoyance at the fact that the only airline management sim that looked interesting to me is one of those "free to play" games that wants you to constantly feed it money. I *will not* do that. However, I may charge some sort of one-time fee to buy (as in, you *own* it) the game. It depends on how confident I am that this game is worth paying for, and/or whether or not I feel like just giving it out.

As I stated in the opening to this readme, I don't have too much idea what I'm doing.
